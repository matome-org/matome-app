# Agent rules

This file is the contract for anyone (human or agent) changing a
repository that uses it. It is self-contained: do not look up an
external skill to commit, and do not invent a second toolchain
beside mise.

The premises, mise rules, and commit rules below are **not**
project-specific. Copy them as-is. Architecture, layout, and
constraints of *this* tree live only under **This project**.

## Premises

- **Performance is a reason to change.** If a change is correct and
  makes sense, do it even when the measured gain is 0.01 ms. Do not
  skip a worthwhile optimisation because the delta is small. Measure
  when the cost of being wrong is high; do not use "nobody can
  perceive it" as a veto.
- **Zero dead code.** Delete unused functions, types, imports, flags,
  and files. Do not leave a replacement beside the thing it replaces.
- **Zero duplicated code.** One implementation of a behaviour. Extract
  or share rather than copy.
- **Zero legacy code.** No compatibility shims, deprecated aliases,
  dual paths, or "keep the old one until later" leftovers. Finish the
  cutover in the same change that introduces the new path.
- **Comments state the code.** A comment names what the next lines
  do, or a constraint the type system cannot. It is not a tutorial,
  a history, or a design essay.
- **Documentation lives in `docs/`.** Guides, measurements, language
  traps, and "how this is meant to be used" go there — not in
  comments, not in commit messages as a substitute for a doc, and not
  in this file except as rules.
- **English only.** Code, comments, commit messages, `docs/`,
  `README.md`, this file, mise task names and descriptions: English.

## Tooling: mise

mise owns the toolchain and every project command. Pin tools in
`mise.toml`. Run `mise install` before work. Invoke tools through
mise (`mise exec -- …` or, once defined, `mise run <task>`). Do not
call a system compiler or helper that is not the pinned one. Do not
add a parallel runner (Make, npm scripts, ad-hoc shell wrappers)
that duplicates a mise task.

### Tasks

Work lives in **scripts**, not in `mise.toml` bodies and not in
`mise-tasks/`. Each script is one job. mise **consumes** those
scripts: a `[tasks.name]` entry names the script, sets
`description` / `depends` / `env` / `sources` / `outputs` /
`usage` / `confirm`, and runs it. Git hooks and any other caller
run the same file. Do not duplicate the job as inline `run =`
shell, a file task, and a script.

- Put scripts under `scripts/`. Make them executable, with a
  shebang. Prefer `MISE_PROJECT_ROOT` when the script must know
  the repo root; otherwise relative paths from the project root
  (mise sets cwd to the directory of `mise.toml`).
- **Atomic:** one script, one responsibility. Compose larger work
  with `depends` (may run in parallel) or a `run` **array** of
  script invocations (sequential; a failure stops the rest,
  `set -e` for `sh`/`bash`/`zsh`). Aggregators (`check`, `bench`,
  `build`) only wire scripts together. The documented entry is
  `mise run <name>`; a hook calls `scripts/<name>`, not a second
  copy of the logic.
- **Idempotent:** running the same script twice with the same
  inputs leaves the tree in the same good state. Safe to re-run
  from a hook, CI, or `mise run`.
- Give every task a `description`. Use `alias` only when the short
  name is used often. Confirm destructive tasks with `confirm`.
- Declare `sources` and `outputs` when a task is skippable if
  inputs have not changed (builds). Use `sources` alone with
  `mise watch`.
- Arguments: a `usage` spec on the TOML task. Values arrive as
  `usage_*` environment variables. Do not use the deprecated Tera
  `arg()` / `option()` / `flag()` helpers.
- Do not add file tasks under `mise-tasks/` (or the other mise
  task directories). Do not keep a TOML task and a file task for
  the same name.
- List and inspect with `mise tasks ls` and
  `mise tasks info <name>`. Run with `mise run <name>`. Do not
  tell the user to `mise exec` a one-off that already has a task.
  Do not tell them to invoke `scripts/` when a task exists, except
  from git hooks and other non-mise entry points that must call
  the script directly.

## Commits (okt-task-commit)

Agents draft and create commits. The human owns publication: **never
`git push`**. When the tree is clean, say that a push is ready.

These rules inline the okt-task-commit playbook, the Conventional
Commits 1.0.0 grammar used with it, and the conventional-commits law.
There is nothing extra to fetch.

### Procedure

1. Read `git status` and `git diff --cached`. If nothing is staged,
   read the unstaged diff (`git diff` and untracked files).
2. Group hunks into **one intent per commit**. Split mixed trees with
   non-interactive staging only: `git add <path>` and
   `git restore --staged <path>`. Do not use `git add -p` or
   `git add -i`.
3. Derive **scope** from the paths touched (package, directory, or
   feature slug).
4. Draft the message (grammar below). Show every draft to the user
   **before** `git commit`.
5. Commit. Do not push. When the working tree is clean, suggest the
   user push when ready.

### Message grammar

```
<type>(<scope>)!: <subject>

<body>

<footer(s)>
```

- **type** (required): `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`,
  `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`. `feat` and `fix` are
  SemVer-significant. One type per commit: a feature and a fix are
  two commits.
- **scope**: noun in parentheses, from the paths. Omit only when no
  scope is honest.
- **!**: immediately before `:` for a breaking change
  (`feat(api)!: …`). Pair with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
- **subject**: English, imperative mood ("Add" not "Added"), ≤50
  characters, no trailing period, lowercase after the colon.
- **body** (optional): wrap at 72 columns. Explain the *why* the
  diff does not. Not a paste of the patch.
- **footers**: `Token: value` lines (`Refs: #123`,
  `BREAKING CHANGE: drops X`).

Never attribute a commit to an agent: no `Co-Authored-By: <model>`,
no `Generated with <tool>`, no model name in trailer or body. The
human running the session is the author. No opt-out. Other
`Co-Authored-By` trailers only if the user asked for that person in
this conversation.

Bad: `feat: add filter and fix duplicate insert` (two intents).
Good: `feat(filter): add priority option` then
`fix(insert): prevent duplicates`.

## This project

- Matome is a Qt 6 Quick client. `matome.pro` builds desktop, WebAssembly,
  and Android targets from `src/core/` and `src/gui/`. The local Android
  build targets an x86_64 emulator; releases include a signed arm64 APK.
- `mise.toml` is the command entry point. Existing platform build and test
  implementations are in `.scripts/`; new automation lives in `scripts/`.
- The local gate is `mise run verify`: QML lint, translation completeness,
  core and studio tests, and the coverage threshold. Web and Android e2e
  have separate mise tasks.
- Release Please runs locally through mise. GitHub Actions packages web,
  macOS, Windows, Linux, and signed Android assets for GitHub Releases.
- `README.md` presents the client and its downloads. Build, test, and
  release instructions live in `docs/`.
