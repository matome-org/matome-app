# about plugins that were found and could not be loaded followed by SIGABRT,
# which reads like a broken build and is almost always a shell that never had
# the graphical environment in it: a bare tty, an ssh session, a service unit,
# or -- by far the most common -- a multiplexer pane older than the session it
# is now sitting in.

# A multiplexer pane keeps the environment it was born with, and the server it
# belongs to was usually started from a session that did have a display -- so
# the answer is one query away and there is no reason to make somebody paste an
# `eval` to get it.
#
# The session environment is asked first and the global one second, and the
# order matters: attaching from ssh copies the attaching shell's environment
# into the session, so a session re-attached from a terminal with no display
# holds `-WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, an explicit "there is none" that shadows the good
# value the server still has.
#
# It says what it took and from where. A window that opens on a screen you are
# not sitting in front of is worse than one that does not open, and over ssh
# that is exactly what this recovery does.
